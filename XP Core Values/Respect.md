Respect is a very important core value that needs to be practiced by each person in the team.
If a person feels valued then they can work with full enthusiasm and maximise productivity. Thus, every person adds calue to the team. 
Similarly, developers should respect not just the team but also the customers and their requirements and vice versa.
Throughout the project, each person was repsonsible for one module each and respected everyone else's appraoches for the other modules as well.
Everyone had respect for each other's work as well as time and commitment.
This helped boost everyone's performance and built a strong working relation amonst the team.
