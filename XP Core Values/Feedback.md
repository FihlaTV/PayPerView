##Feedback:

Feedback is an XP core value which helps in increasing productivity by demonstrating our software right from the early phases, and listening to any changes required.
This way, feeback can be taken into consideration for every iteration so that changes are implemented earlier rather than detecting issues in later phases.
This can help identify the exact requirement of the clients and will help to avoid a lot of rework.
By taking the feedback into consideration, we can talk about our project and then adapt our processes to the project than having to make a lot of modifications and patches in the end.
