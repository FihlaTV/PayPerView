## Simplicity

Simplpcity as a core value refers to the idea of correctly identifying what is required and only doing what is required instead of wasting resources to work on unnecessary functionalities at the cost of hampering development of the required ones.
This will maximize the value created for the investment in the project. 
This will also help in mitigating failures as they happen since simple steps will be followed by us in an incremental way.
By following this core value, we can create something we are proud of and will also be able to maintain it long term for reasonable costs.
