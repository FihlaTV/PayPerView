My Core Value - FeedBack and Respect
Took everyone's feedback at each iteration of the development phase.
Made sure that all changes are discussed and feedback from all team members is being listened to and incorporated.
Also, ensures that everyone's work is respected and everyone feels comfortable in order to maximize productivity.
